Dear Team,

I have completed the tasks for adding and deleting insights. Additionally, I took the initiative to implement the update functionality as well. The frontend is also fully integrated.

Iâ€™ll be committing the code to GitHub shortly and will share the repository link with you.

The implementation was straightforward, and I now have a solid understanding of the architecture.

Best regards,
Zubair Ismail
